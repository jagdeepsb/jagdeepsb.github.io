Evolution Gym is the first benchmark tool for studying soft robot co-optimization: jointly optimizing a robot's body and brain. We built EvoGym to have 1) A fast soft-body simulator 2) OpenAI Gym inspired python interface and 3) over 30 environments in order to overcome the prior intractability and irreproducibility of soft robot co-design experiments. In addition, we proposed 3 SOTA co-design algorithms and benchmarked them extensively on all EvoGym environments to establish baseline performance in this field. We hope EvoGym will lead to the development of increasingly intelligent robots! [Code](https://github.com/EvolutionGym/evogym) and extensive [docs](https://evolutiongym.github.io/) are available!
