How do we collect an internet-scale robotics dataset? The logistics of real-world data collection make scaling difficult, requiring expensive robot hardware, physical environments, and time-consuming scene resets. DexHub is a simulation-based robotics crowdsourcing platform that only requires a VR headset. Compared to alternatives, non-experts can collect data x2 faster with DexHub. Leveraging the flexibility of simulation, policies trained with DexHub are more robust than their real-world counterparts. Try it with [Apple Vision Pro](https://dexhub.ai/login)!

<!-- Evolution Gym is the first benchmark tool for studying soft robot co-optimization: jointly optimizing a robot's body and brain. We built EvoGym to have 1) A fast soft-body simulator 2) OpenAI Gym inspired python interface and 3) over 30 environments in order to overcome the prior intractability and irreproducibility of soft robot co-design experiments. In addition, we proposed 3 SOTA co-design algorithms and benchmarked them extensively on all EvoGym environments to establish baseline performance in this field. We hope EvoGym will lead to the development of increasingly intelligent robots! [Code](https://github.com/EvolutionGym/evogym) and extensive [docs](https://evolutiongym.github.io/) are available! -->
